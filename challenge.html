                <h3>Case Study</h3>
                <p class="black-text-color">Yakato 45th yeard old, is an expat from Japan who work in Japanese company and live alone in Bali, Indonesia for just 1 month.  He is not fluent in English nor bahasa. 
                    In the next 2 weeks, his boss is going to have a birthday, and Yakato want to buy custom wallet with beautyful local Balinese design to his boss. </p>
                <p>So, what i think about it? to be honesly i should not make expetation, but because Yakato is not here i will try to solve his problem. I try to make website from brand "From Bali" thats just name. This website is provide any Bali product custom.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-7">
                <h3>Yakato User Persona</h3>
                <img src="image/yakato user persona.jpg" width="700px" class="img-fluid" alt="">

            <div class="continer text-center mt-5">
                <h1>Define Focus</h1>
                <p> So, what Yakato problem? This is more about persona</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="image/more persona.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="continer text-center mt-5">
                <h1>Ideation</h1>
                <p>As always i use The value proposition canvas because this tool make me easy to determine what a solution from the problem or how to catch the hope</p>
                <p><strong>Let me describe my ide. </strong>
                <div class="row  black-text-color">
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li> First problem is He is not fluent in English nor bahasa, so that i try Use language that is easy to understand and simple</li>
                        <li> Second problem is sometimes when it is expected with several choices, people will get confused which one to choose. Are u remember when i tell u abaout my favorite UI is gojek? Because gojek is give me choose when i want to buy a food, so i not confuse again.
                            So the solution is there are best product features so that customers can consider their choices.
                        </li>
                        <li> Then the problem is In this case, Yakato already likes the design of the shop. To be honesly if i want, i can just make Yakato only can order wallet with design from suplier. But when i think again, what if Yakato has his own design? So that i make one fiture more. There is a feature to use your own design</li>
                        <li>Last problem is sometimes a customer wants to customize the model and shape of the wallet, so that there are features to request shapes and models according to customer needs</li>
                        <li>And dont forget Yakato hope. Yakato want buy custom wallet items with beautiful balinese design <strong>easily</strong>, so i want to make clear CTA, so that Yakato can guess what will happen next</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
